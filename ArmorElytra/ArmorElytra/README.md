# ArmorElytra Plugin

ArmorElytra is a Spigot plugin for Minecraft that allows players to combine a chestplate with an elytra using an anvil. This gives the chestplate the ability to function as an elytra when the player double presses the spacebar.

## Features

- Combine any chestplate with an elytra using an anvil.
- The resulting chestplate retains the properties of the original chestplate while gaining elytra functionality.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the ArmorElytra plugin.
2. Place the `ArmorElytra.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your Spigot server.
3. Restart the server or use the `/reload` command.

## Usage

To use the plugin:

1. Open an anvil.
2. Place the chestplate of your choice in the first slot.
3. Place an elytra in the second slot.
4. Take the newly created item from the output slot. This chestplate can now be used as an elytra when you double press the spacebar.

## Configuration

The plugin comes with a configuration file located at `src/main/resources/config.yml`. You can modify this file to customize various options for the plugin.
